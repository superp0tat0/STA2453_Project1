# STA2453_Project1
This the project 1 repo for STA2453

Use the Indeed salary finder website to scrape several job descriptions along with salaries. Then build a predictive model that uses the data predict the salary of a job.

For example, you could scrape some example salaries and job descriptions for Data Scientists, Statisticians, Data Analysts, Data entry Clerks, etc..

You could then build some input features for a model that predicts salaries from the job descriptions. This would likely involve some basic natural language processing (which will be covered next term) to build features like: years experience, masters degree required, requires python, etc…

You wouldn’t be graded on the accuracy of any such model. You would be graded on the process you used to extract the data, clean the data, model the data, and clarity in describing the results.
